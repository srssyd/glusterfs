# See the big header comment at the start of gen_fdl.py to see how the stages
# fit together.  The big difference here is that *all* of the C code is in the
# template file as labelled fragments, instead of as Python strings.  That
# makes it much easier to edit in one place, with proper syntax highlighting
# and indentation.
#
#   Stage 1 uses type-specific fragments to generate FUNCTION_BODY, instead of
#   LEN_*_TEMPLATE and SERLZ_*_TEMPLATE to generate LEN_CODE and SER_CODE.
#
#   Stage 2 uses the FOP and CASE fragments instead of RECON_TEMPLATE and
#   FOP_TEMPLATE.  The expanded FOP code (including FUNCTION_BODY substitution
#   in the middle of each function) is emitted immediately; the expanded CASE
#   code is saved for the next stage.
#
#   Stage 3 uses the PROLOG and EPILOG fragments, with the expanded CASE code
#   in the middle of EPILOG, to generate the whole output file.
#
# Another way of looking at it is to consider how the fragments appear in
# the final output:
#
#   PROLOG
#   FOP (expanded for CREATE)
#       FOP before FUNCTION_BODY
#       LOC, INTEGER, GFID, etc. (one per arg, by type)
#       FOP after FUNCTION_BODY
#   FOP (expanded for WRITEV)
#       FOP before FUNCTION_BODY
#       GFID, VECTOR, etc. (one per arg, by type)
#       FOP after FUNCTION_BODY
#   (more FOPs)
#   EPILOG
#       EPILOG before CASE
#       CASE statements (one per fop)
#       EPILOG after CASE
